# Fried Plantain Technical Blog

---

**First Post** [*Fri Feb 16 10:53 AM 2024*]

This is my "technical blog". I am Indian university student majoring in CS. "Fried Plantain" (technically inaccurate, so I've heard from searching online, that real plantains are in Africa and the vegetable I'm referring to, "aratikaya", is the "cooking banana") is a dish I ate with rice and dal back home which I liked very much and I was hungry when I was thinking about blog names. I have come to the conclusion that FPTB is too hard to say, so I will abbreviate it moving on as FPT or simply plantain blog.

What will I talk about here? The blog posts I find useful are ones that describe features and simple user configuration of programs. I would also like to read comparisons between libraries or programs that serve the same purpose. Finally some short notes on interesting projects, maybe. News might also be interesting but I've never read much of that but I think I might in the future.

I will have blog-posts and (blog-)notes, the notes are much shorter at around 1 or 2 paragraphs and might not even have a proper title. The blog posts will have a fixed theme and might be around 2 pages of real paper. For my first blog-note, here is something I was thinking about yesterday. It's easiest just to paste it here because I haven't set up a proper system yet (I don't plan on making that complicated though).

> Hello everyone. Welcome back to plantain blog. I have been thinking that the internet is bad for programming knowledge/debugging etc. Of course in some cases it's unavoidable but I would say in the long term it really is just better to read books/manuals. Because rarely do you just want to solve a specific problem in a vacuum, really you will have other related problems later, in which case reading the manual will help you understand those other problems. What will you do when your search engine fails you? And if it is a waste of time to read manuals, isn't it a waste of time to go through all of those wrong stackoverflow answers? And calling it a manual is a bad thing, really, because I realise they're actually very short. Most are probably less than 20 pages.
